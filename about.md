Hi, I’m Ben, a web developer for Up&Up in Greenville, SC. I’m a naturally curious person and always love to learn because it keeps life interesting.

## Where am I from?

I was born in North Carolina but raised all over–including Tokyo, Beijing, Chicagoland, and even New England. I like to think that moving and traveling in my childhood taught me some of the most invaluable lessons in life, but I still went to get a BA in Communications and Media Studies from Wheaton College in Illinois.

## Where have I worked?

I’ve worked for major media companies like the Chicago Tribune, Apartments.com, Cars.com and Gannett Company doing marketing consulting and advertising sales. I’ve even started my own publishing venture, Second Nature Journal, as well as a non-profit institute just for fun. Check out my LinkedIn profile if you’d like some more details.

## What can I do?

I build fast, interactive, responsive websites using a variety of tools. My favorite toolset includes using SCSS with Compass, jQuery, and HTML5. My responsibilities at Up&Up range from doing a complete front-end to integrating a front-end and backend setup, to even developing a backend in Wordpress or Drupal.

I also enjoy planning and executing strategic integrated marketing campaigns, including paid search, SEO, social media marketing, email marketing, print, and targeted digital display. My favorite part of this? Proving results by sifting through the data to tell a story. Analytics are key to any marketing campaign and I’d say web analytics is one of my specialties.

## What do I do for fun?

In my free time I enjoy biking, hiking, exploring Greenville, learning new things, and hanging out at Greenville’s awesome public library.
