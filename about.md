Hi, I’m Ben, a friendly web developer for [Up&Up](https://www.upandup.agency) in Greenville, SC. In my free time I enjoy biking, hiking, gardening, exploring Greenville, learning new things, and hanging out at our awesome public library.

I create fun, innovative, accessible, and fast websites. This includes [award-winning](https://www.upandup.agency/awards/upup-wins-ucda-excellence-award-university-kentucky-website) front-end development as well as building out custom Drupal and Wordpress backends with an eye towards usability.

## Side Projects / Volunteering

### Second Nature Journal
I started and run (with the help of some friends) an online journal for critical thinking about technology and new media in light of the Christian tradition, [Second Nature](https://secondnaturejournal.com/). We've been running since 2013. I'm an editor and jack-of-all trades.

### IISTC
The IISTC ([International Institute for the Study of Technology and Christianity](https://iistc.org/)) is the non-profit we started to publish Second Nature. I'm an executive director.

### Engaged Encounter
My lovely wife and I are presenting couples for [South Carolina Catholic Engaged Encounter](http://www.cee-sc.org/). We provide weekend-long marriage preparation retreats for engaged couples. I am also the treasurer.

## About this site

This site is a simple, responsive [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme I designed and built using the Minima theme as the initial structure. My display font is [Raleway Extra-Bold](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and the body font is [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville). Fonts are served from Google Fonts. I borrowed my link styles from the [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) project.
