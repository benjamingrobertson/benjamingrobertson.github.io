Hi, I’m Ben, a front-end web developer in Greenville, SC for [Mediacurrent](http://www.mediacurrent.com/). In my free time I enjoy biking, hiking, gardening, exploring Greenville, learning new things, and hanging out at our awesome public library.

I create fun, innovative, accessible, and fast websites. I try to leave every bit I code I touch more readable, performant and accessible than I found it.

These are the accomplishments I'm most proud of:

 - Spearheaded the agency use of pattern libraries and wrote about it for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/build-style-guide-straight-sass/).
 - Developed an internal [CSS style guide](/front-end/css-standards) for standardizing our approach to CSS/Sass for across all projects.
 - Led the agency adoption of SVG and automated build tools.
 - Learned Drupal 7 on the fly, developed an [award-winning Drupal 7 site for the University of Kentucky](https://www.upandup.agency/awards/upup-wins-ucda-excellence-award-university-kentucky-website) and became lead Drupal developer.
 - Led the team in documenting front-end and server configuration best practices to streamline current development and help onboard new developers.
