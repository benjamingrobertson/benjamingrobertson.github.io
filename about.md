Hi, I’m Ben, a friendly web developer for [Up&Up](https://upandup.agency) in Greenville, SC. In my free time I enjoy biking, hiking, gardening, exploring Greenville, learning new things, and hanging out at our awesome public library.

I specialize in creating fun, innovative, accessible, and fast web experiences for end users and the people who serve them. This includes [award-winning](https://www.upandup.agency/awards/upup-wins-ucda-excellence-award-university-kentucky-website) front-end development as well as building out custom Drupal and Wordpress backends with an eye towards usability.

## Side Projects

## Where am I from?

I was born in North Carolina but raised all over–including Tokyo, Beijing, Chicagoland, and even New England. I like to think that moving and traveling in my childhood taught me some of the most invaluable lessons in life, but I still went to get a BA in Communications and Media Studies from Wheaton College in Illinois.

## Where have I worked?

I’ve worked for major media companies like the Chicago Tribune, Apartments.com, Cars.com and Gannett Company doing marketing consulting and advertising sales. I’ve even started my own publishing venture, Second Nature Journal, as well as a non-profit institute just for fun. Check out my LinkedIn profile if you’d like some more details.

## What can I do?

I build fast, interactive, responsive websites using a variety of tools. My favorite toolset includes using SCSS with Compass, jQuery, and HTML5. My responsibilities at Up&Up range from doing a complete front-end to integrating a front-end and backend setup, to even developing a backend in Wordpress or Drupal.
