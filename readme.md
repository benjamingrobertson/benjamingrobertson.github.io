This is my personal site. I based it on the default Jekyll Minima theme, with some tweaks to make it my own.

## Todos
 - Refactor the syntax-highlighting
 - add a portfolio section
 - Make it a [PWA](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/going-offline/)
 - Extend the updates on the home page with micropub functionality.
 - Replace the disqus comments on blog posts with webmentions.
