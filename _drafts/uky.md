The University of Kentucky wanted a better way for students to be able to explore available majors at the university as well as build a more user-friendly home for curriculum information used by students and faculty advisors.

The [academic exploration tool](http://www.uky.edu/academics) is what our design team came up with to solve this problem. When users land on the page, they are prompted with a few different ways to explore course information. They can search by interest (i.e. "I like to... spend time outside"), career path ("I want to be a doctor"), or they can do a keyword search ("biology"). They end up on a filterable results page that contains the results of their query. From there they can go on to get more info about their desired program, filter their results, or search again.

My role in this project was lead developer. I led the front-end development effort as well as the development of the Drupal backend.
