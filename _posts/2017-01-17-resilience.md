snippet: "What makes you resilient to trauma is to own yourself fully."

> And so what we have learned is that what makes you resilient to trauma is to own yourself fully. So if somebody says hurtful or insulting things, you can say, "interesting, that person is saying hurtful and insulting things." But you can separate your sense of yourself from them. We are really beginning to seriously understand how human beings can learn how to do that, to observe, and not react.
